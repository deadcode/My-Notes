Franz Josef Gall (German: [[gal]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German); 9 March 1758 – 22 August 1828) was a [neuroanatomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomist), [physiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology), and pioneer in the study of the localization of mental functions in the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain).

Claimed as the founder of [phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall#cite_note-1) Gall was an early and important researcher in his fields. His contributions to the field of neuropsychology were controversial at the time and now widely referred to as pseudoscience. However, Gall's study of phrenology helped establish psychology as a science, contributed to the emergence of the naturalistic approach to the study of man, and played an important part in the development of evolutionist theories, anthropology, and sociology.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall#cite_note-2)

Gall's concepts on brain localization were revolutionary, and caused religious leaders and some scientists to take exception. The [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) considered his theory as contrary to [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion). Established science also condemned these ideas for lack of [scientific proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_proof) of his theory. Still others attempted to discredit Gall because they believed he had not given rightful credit to the theories and scientists who influenced him. [Étienne-Jean Georget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jean_Georget) accused Gall of stealing [Charles Bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bonnet)'s basic idea of brain localization that he had written about over 60 years earlier.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall#cite_note-18)

His ideas were also not acceptable to the court of the emperor [Joseph II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) (the brother of [Marie Antoinette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette)). The Austrian government accused Gall of being a materialist and banned his ideas because of their threat to public morality.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall#cite_note-19) Due to this opposition, Gall left his lecturer position in Austria. He sought a teaching position in Germany and eventually settled in Paris. Revolutionary France was most likely the most hospitable place for Gall's theories. However, [Napoleon Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte), the ruling [emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor), and the scientific establishment led by the [Institute of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_France), pronounced his science as invalid. Despite all this, Gall was able to secure a comfortable existence on the basis of his speciality. He became a celebrity of sorts as he was accepted into Parisian intellectual salons.

Gall's phrenological theories and practices were best accepted in England, where the ruling class used it to justify the "inferiority" of its colonial subjects.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] It also became very popular in the USA from 1820 to 1850.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] One interesting influence was on psychiatry, where the South Italian psychiatrist Biagio Gioacchino Miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were conceived in Gall’s phrenology.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall#cite_note-20)

In spite of many problems associated with his work, Gall made significant contributions to neurological science. He died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married, he remained childless. Some direct descendants of his brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A collection of his skulls can be seen at the Rollett Museum in [Baden bei Wien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden_bei_Wien), Austria, where several of his relatives now live.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall#cite_note-21)

Today, phrenology is thought of as a huge misstep by the scientific community. The idea that a person's personality could be determined by the shape of their skull has been repeatedly disproven. But at the time, Gall's arguments were persuasive and intriguing. Even though phrenology is now known to be incorrect, Gall did set the groundwork for modern neuroscience by spreading the idea of functional localization within the brain.

The misuse of Gall's ideas and work to justify discrimination were deliberately furthered by his associates, including [Johann Spurzheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Spurzheim). Later, others tried to improve on his theories with systems such as [characterology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterology).

Gall's theories had an influence both on the Italian criminologist [Cesare Lombroso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Lombroso) and on his French rival, [Alexandre Lacassagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Lacassagne). He also influenced the French anatomist, [Paul Broca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Broca).
