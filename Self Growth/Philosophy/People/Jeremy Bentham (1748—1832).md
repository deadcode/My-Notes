Jeremy Bentham was an English philosopher and political radical. He is primarily known today for his [moral philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics), especially his principle of utilitarianism, which evaluates actions based upon their consequences. The relevant consequences, in particular, are the overall happiness created for everyone affected by the action. Influenced by many enlightenment thinkers, especially empiricists such as [John Locke](http://www.iep.utm.edu/locke) and [David Hume](http://www.iep.utm.edu/humelife), Bentham developed an ethical theory grounded in a largely empiricist account of human nature. He famously held a hedonistic account of both motivation and value according to which what is fundamentally valuable and what ultimately motivates us is pleasure and pain. Happiness, according to Bentham, is thus a matter of experiencing pleasure and lack of pain.

Although he never practiced law, Bentham did write a great deal of [philosophy of law](http://www.iep.utm.edu/law-phil), spending most of his life critiquing the existing law and strongly advocating legal reform. Throughout his work, he critiques various [natural accounts of law](http://www.iep.utm.edu/natlaw) which claim, for example, that liberty, rights, and so on exist independent of government. In this way, Bentham arguably developed an early form of what is now often called "[legal positivism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/legalpos)." Beyond such critiques, he ultimately maintained that putting his moral theory into consistent practice would yield results in legal theory by providing justification for social, political, and legal institutions.

Bentham's influence was minor during his life. But his impact was greater in later years as his ideas were carried on by followers such as [John Stuart Mill](http://www.iep.utm.edu/milljs), John Austin, and other [consequentialists](http://www.iep.utm.edu/conseque).
