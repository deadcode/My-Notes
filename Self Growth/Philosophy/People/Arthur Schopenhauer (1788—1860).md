Arthur Schopenhauer has been dubbed the artist’s philosopher on account of the inspiration his aesthetics has provided to artists of all stripes. He is also known as the philosopher of pessimism, as he articulated a worldview that challenges the value of existence. His elegant and muscular prose earn him a reputation as one the greatest German stylists. Although he never achieved the fame of such post-Kantian philosophers as [Johann Gottlieb Fichte](http://www.iep.utm.edu/fichtejg/) and [G.W.F. Hegel](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hegelsoc/) in his lifetime, his thought informed the work of such luminaries as [Sigmund Freud](http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/), [Ludwig Wittgenstein](http://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens/) and, most famously, [Friedrich Nietzsche](http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/). He is also known as the first German philosopher to incorporate Eastern thought into his writings.

Schopenhauer’s thought is iconoclastic for a number of reasons. Although he considered himself [Kant](http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/)’s only true philosophical heir, he argued that the world was essentially irrational. Writing in the era of German Romanticism, he developed an aesthetics that was classicist in its emphasis on the eternal. When German philosophers were entrenched in the universities and immersed in the theological concerns of the time, Schopenhauer was an atheist who stayed outside the academic profession.

Schopenhauer’s lack of recognition during most of his lifetime may have been due to the iconoclasm of his thought, but it was probably also partly due to his irascible and stubborn temperament. The diatribes against Hegel and Fichte peppered throughout his works provide evidence of his state of mind. Regardless of the reason Schopenhauer’s philosophy was overlooked for so long, he fully deserves the prestige he enjoyed altogether too late in his life.
