Plato is one of the world's best known and most widely read and studied philosophers. He was the student of Socrates and the teacher of [Aristotle](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aristotl), and he wrote in the middle of the fourth century B.C.E. in ancient Greece. Though influenced primarily by Socrates, to the extent that Socrates is usually the main character in many of Plato's writings, he was also influenced by [Heraclitus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/heraclit), [Parmenides](http://www.iep.utm.edu/parmenid), and the [Pythagoreans](http://www.iep.utm.edu/pythagor).

There are varying degrees of controversy over which of Plato's works are authentic, and in what order they were written, due to their antiquity and the manner of their preservation through time. Nonetheless, his earliest works are generally regarded as the most reliable of the ancient sources on Socrates, and the character Socrates that we know through these writings is considered to be one of the greatest of the ancient philosophers.
