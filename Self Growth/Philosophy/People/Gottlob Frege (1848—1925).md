Gottlob Frege was a German logician, mathematician and philosopher who played a crucial role in the emergence of modern logic and analytic philosophy. Frege's logical works were revolutionary, and are often taken to represent the fundamental break between contemporary approaches and the older, Aristotelian tradition. He invented modern quantificational logic, and created the first fully axiomatic system for logic, which was complete in its treatment of [propositional](http://www.iep.utm.edu/prop-log) and first-order logic, and also represented the first treatment of higher-order logic. In the philosophy of mathematics, he was one of the most ardent proponents of logicism, the thesis that mathematical truths are logical truths, and presented influential criticisms of rival views such as psychologism and formalism. His theory of meaning, especially his distinction between the sense and reference of linguistic expressions, was groundbreaking in semantics and the [philosophy of language](http://www.iep.utm.edu/freg-lan/). He had a profound and direct influence on such thinkers as Russell, [Carnap](http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap) and [Wittgenstein](http://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens). Frege is often called the founder of modern logic, and he is sometimes even heralded as the founder of [analytic philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/analytic/).
