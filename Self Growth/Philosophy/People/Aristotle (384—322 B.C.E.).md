Aristotle is a towering figure in [ancient Greek philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/), making contributions to logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, [ethics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/), politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre. He was a student of [Plato](http://www.iep.utm.edu/plato/) who in turn studied under Socrates. He was more empirically-minded than Plato or Socrates and is famous for rejecting Plato's theory of forms.

As a prolific writer and polymath, Aristotle radically transformed most, if not all, areas of knowledge he touched. It is no wonder that [Aquinas](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aquinas/) referred to him simply as "The Philosopher." In his lifetime, Aristotle wrote as many as 200 treatises, of which only 31 survive. Unfortunately for us, these works are in the form of lecture notes and draft manuscripts never intended for general readership, so they do not demonstrate his reputed polished prose style which attracted many great followers, including the Roman [Cicero](http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/). Aristotle was the first to classify areas of human knowledge into distinct disciplines such as mathematics, biology, and ethics. Some of these classifications are still used today.
