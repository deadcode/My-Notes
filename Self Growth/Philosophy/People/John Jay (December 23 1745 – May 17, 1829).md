was an American statesman, [Patriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_\(American_Revolution\)), diplomat, one of the [Founding Fathers of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States), signatory of the [Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\(1783\)) of 1783, second [Governor of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York), and the first [Chief Justice of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States) (1789–1795). He directed U.S. foreign policy for much of the 1780s and was an important leader of the [Federalist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party_\(United_States\)) after the ratification of the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution) in 1788.

Jay was born into a wealthy family of merchants and government officials in New York City. He became a lawyer and joined the New York Committee of Correspondence, organizing opposition to [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain) polices in the time preceding the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution). Jay was elected to the [Second Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress), and he served as the [President of the Second Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Continental_Congress). From 1779 to 1782, Jay served as the [ambassador to Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Spain), and he convinced Spain to provide financial aid to the fledgling United States. He also served as a negotiator of the Treaty of Paris, in which Britain recognized American independence. Following the end of the war, Jay served as [Secretary of Foreign Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs), directing [United States foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_policy) under the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation) government. He would also serve as the first [Secretary of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State) on an interim basis.

A proponent of strong, centralized government, Jay worked to ratify the United States Constitution in New York in 1788 by pseudonymously writing five of the several [The Federalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist) papers, along with the main authors [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton) and [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison). After the establishment of the new federal government, Jay was appointed by President [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington) to become the first Chief Justice of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1795. The [Jay Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Court) experienced a light workload, deciding just four cases over six years. In 1794, while serving as Chief Justice, Jay negotiated the highly controversial [Jay Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty) with Britain. Jay received a handful of [electoral votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_received_an_electoral_vote_in_the_United_States_Electoral_College) in three of the first four presidential elections, but never undertook a serious bid for the presidency.

Jay served as the [Governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_New_York) of [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_\(state\)) from 1795 to 1801. Long an opponent of [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States), he helped enact a law that provided for the gradual emancipation of slaves, and the institution of slavery [was abolished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States) in New York in Jay's lifetime. In the waning days of President [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams)'s administration, Jay was confirmed by the Senate for another term as Chief Justice, but he declined the position and retired to his farm in [Westchester County, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York).
