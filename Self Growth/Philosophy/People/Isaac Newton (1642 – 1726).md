Sir Isaac Newton [PRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Royal_Society) ([/ˈnjuːtən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English);[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-6) 25 December 1642 – 20 March [1726/27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#cite_note-OSNS-1)) was an English [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy), and [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) (described in his own day as a "[natural philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy)") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the [scientific revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_revolution). His book [Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica) ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics). Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics), and he shares credit with [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) for developing the infinitesimal [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus).

Newton's Principia formulated the [laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion) and [universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion) from his mathematical description of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity), and using the same principles to account for the [trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory) of [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet), the [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide), the [precession of the equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession), and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism) model of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) and demonstrated that the [motion of objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_%28mechanics%29) on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and of [celestial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics) bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's theoretical prediction that the Earth is shaped as an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroid) was later vindicated by the geodetic measurements of [Maupertuis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis), [La Condamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Marie_de_La_Condamine), and others, thus convincing most [Continental European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe) scientists of the superiority of [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics) over the earlier system of [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes).
