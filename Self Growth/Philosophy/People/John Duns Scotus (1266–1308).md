John Duns Scotus, along with Bonaventure, [Aquinas](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aquinas), and [Ockham](http://www.iep.utm.edu/ockham), is one of the four great philosophers of High Scholasticism. His work is encyclopedic in scope, yet so detailed and nuanced that he earned the epithet “Subtle Doctor,” and no less a thinker than Ockham would praise his judgment as excelling all others in its subtlety. In opposition to the prevailing thought in metaphysics that the term “being” is analogical, Scotus argues that it must be a univocal term, a view others had feared would bring an end to metaphysics and natural theology. Scotus’s novel account of [universals](http://www.iep.utm.edu/universa/) and individuation gained a wide following and inspired brilliant counterarguments by Ockham and Thomist opponents. Despite its flaws, his argument for [God](http://www.iep.utm.edu/god-west)’s existence, perhaps the most complicated of any ever written, is a philosophical tour de force. Scotus’s distinction between intuitive and abstractive cognition structured much of the discussion of cognition for the rest of the scholastic period. In opposition to such thinkers as Aquinas and Godfrey of Fontaines, Scotus defends a moderate [voluntarism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/doxa-vol/) in his account of free will, a view that would be influential into the modern period.
