# Charlemagne ([/ˈʃɑːrlɪmeɪn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) or Charles the Great[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-2) (2 April 742[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcKitterick200872-1)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-3) – 28 January 814)

numbered Charles I, was [King of the Franks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Franks) from 768, [King of the Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Lombards) from 774 and [Emperor of the Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor) from 800. He united much of Europe during the early [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages). He was the first recognised[[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions)] emperor in western Europe since the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire) three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the [Carolingian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Empire).

Charlemagne was the oldest son of [Pepin the Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepin_the_Short) and [Bertrada of Laon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrada_of_Laon), having been born before their canonical marriage.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-4) He became king in 768 following his father's death, initially as co-ruler with his brother [Carloman I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carloman_I_of_the_Franks). Carloman's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne as the sole, undisputed ruler of the Frankish Kingdom.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-5) He continued his father's policy towards the [papacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) and became its protector, removing the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into [Muslim Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus). He campaigned against the [Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons) to his east, [Christianising them upon penalty of death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitulatio_de_partibus_Saxoniae) and leading to events such as the [Massacre of Verden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_Verden). Charlemagne reached the height of his power in 800 when he was [crowned Emperor of the Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_Holy_Roman_Emperor) by [Pope Leo III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_III) on Christmas Day at Rome's [Old St. Peter's Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_St._Peter%27s_Basilica).

Charlemagne has been called the "Father of Europe" (Pater Europae),[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-6) as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) and united parts of Europe that had never been under Roman rule. His rule spurred the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance), a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church. All [Holy Roman Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Holy_Roman_Emperors) considered their kingdoms to be descendants of Charlemagne's empire, up to the last [Emperor Francis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) and the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_monarchs) and [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_monarchs)monarchies.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

However, the [Eastern Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) views Charlemagne more controversially, labeling as [heterodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodoxy) his support of the [filioque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filioque) and recognition by the [Bishop of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Rome) as legitimate Roman Emperor, rather than recognising [Irene of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Athens) of the [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire). These and other machinations led to the eventual split of Rome and Constantinople in the [Great Schism of 1054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGregory2005251.E2.80.93252-7)[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne#cite_note-8)

Charlemagne died in 814, having ruled as emperor for thirteen years. He was laid to rest in his imperial capital city of [Aachen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen). He married at least four times and had three legitimate sons, but only his son [Louis the Pious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_the_Pious) survived to succeed him.
