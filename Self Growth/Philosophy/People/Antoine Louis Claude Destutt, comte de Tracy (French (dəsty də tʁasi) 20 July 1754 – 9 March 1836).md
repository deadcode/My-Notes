was a [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enlightenment) [aristocrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy_\(class\)) and [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher) who coined the term "[ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology)".

The son of a distinguished soldier, Claude Destutt, he was born in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris). His family was of Scottish descent, tracing its origin to Walter Stutt, who in 1420 had accompanied the Earls of Buchan and Douglas to the court of France, and whose family afterwards rose to be counts of Tracy. He was educated at home and at the [University of Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Strasbourg), where he was noted for his athletic skill. He went into the army, and when the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) broke out, he took an active part in the provincial assembly of Bourbonnais. Elected a deputy of the nobility to the states-general, he sat alongside his friend, the [Marquis de La Fayette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_La_Fayette). In the spring of 1792, he received the rank of maréchal de camp in command of the cavalry in the army of the north; but the influence of the extremists becoming predominant he took indefinite leave of absence, and settled at [Auteuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy), where, with [Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet) and [Cabanis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Jean_George_Cabanis), he devoted himself to scientific studies.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Destutt_de_Tracy#cite_note-EB1911-1)

Under the [Reign of Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror), he was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year, during which he studied [Condillac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Bonnot_de_Condillac) and [Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke), and abandoned the natural sciences for philosophy.

In 1795, he was named associate of the [Institut de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_de_France);[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Destutt_de_Tracy#cite_note-Byrnes2010-2) this was the year when the Institut was established. On the motion of Cabanis, he was named in the class of the moral and political sciences. He soon began to attract attention by the memoires which he read before his colleagues—papers which formed the first draft of his comprehensive work on [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology), named Eléments d'idéologie. He conceived of ideology as the "science of ideas." The society of "ideologists" at Auteuil embraced, besides Cabanis and Tracy, [Constantin-François de Chassebœuf, Comte de Volney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin-Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Chasseb%C5%93uf,_Comte_de_Volney) and [Dominique Joseph Garat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Joseph_Garat), professor in the National Institute.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Destutt_de_Tracy#cite_note-EB1911-1) (See also: [Les Neuf Sœurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Neuf_S%C5%93urs))

Under the [Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Empire), Tracy was a member of the senate, but took little part in its deliberations. Under the [Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Dynasty,_Restored) he became a [peer of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_of_France), but protested against the reactionary split of the government, and remained in opposition. In 1808, he was elected a member of the [Académie française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise) in place of Cabanis, and in 1832, he was also named a member of the Academy of Moral Sciences on its reorganization. He appeared, however, only once at its conferences, owing to his age and to disappointment at the comparative failure of his work. Destutt de Tracy was one of the principal advocates of [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism)during and after the Revolution. He died in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Destutt_de_Tracy#cite_note-EB1911-1)
